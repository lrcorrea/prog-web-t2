                                In today’s age, the use of mobile devices to access the internet has grown and become quite popular. Almost every internet user desires a mobile version of the website.

                                However, most websites are not as optimized as they should be for mobile devices. The testers should perform a mobile responsive test on responsive designs.

                                Microsoft Office, <strong>for example</strong>, looks the same on every personal computer. Imagine taking Microsoft Word exactly as it runs on your desktop, and viewing it on an iPhone4. Either the menus and buttons will appear tiny, or else you’ll only see a corner of the screen, and need to use extensive scrollbars. Either way, the application becomes essentially unusable.

                                This frustrating experience is exactly what every designer goes through when they try to design for the web.

                                The fix for the problem is something called “responsive design”, a technique to have web pages ask the browser what the resolution is, then gracefully re-design the user experience based on the available screen real estate. Suddenly, it is impossible to know exactly how your software will look in production.
                            </p>

                                That means a test strategy (and an automation strategy) that needs to be capable of experimenting and learning what “looks right”, and what doesn’t, at various resolutions.

                                When we try to open a website, the server reads “m.sub-domains” to identify what kind of mobile device the request originated from. Based on that, it redirects the user to the corresponding mobile version.

                                To make this 100% effective, each device should have its own design of the website specifically built for it; for example, a different specific design for Blackberry, iPhone, iPad, etc. taking into account their screen size and resolutions.

                                However, different web version for every resolution and device is not practical. The Ethan Marcotte came up with a new approach- Responsive Web Design (RWD) – that solves this problem.

                                RWD targets for websites to react to their device, resolution and be able to render and adapt correctly. For example, if the user switches from desktop/ laptop to iPad, then the website should automatically adapt the resolution changes like image size etc. as per the respective device abilities.

                                <li>RW design uses breakpoints to identify the layout of a site. Each design is used at different breakpoints. One design is applied over a breakpoint whereas another design is used below the breakpoint. These breakpoints are generally based on the width of the browsers.</li>

However, AWD might not be suitable all the time. Besides, designing AWD sites takes more time and money in comparison to the RWD sites.

                                The Responsive design test means testing the website or URL from different devices. Practically, it is not possible to test the responsive website completely because to do so we need to set up various systems for various screen sizes.

                            <p class="uk-margin-medium-top">
                                A possible way for the responsive test is by resizing the browser window size as per the test scenario.

                                Some browsers, such as IE and Safari will provide plug-ins or browser extensions which will help you view the viewport area in pixels. This makes the testing easy by getting the desired screen size by modifying the pixels.
                            </p>
                            <p class="uk-margin-medium-top">
                                Other browsers like Chrome provide software or program called “Emulator” which will help change the screen features and environment as per the desired device needed for testing.
                            </p>
                            <p class="uk-margin-medium-top">
                                <strong>Note: “Emulator”</strong> is software or program that is provided within the browser which makes the host system (current browser) behave like the guest system (browser of the desired device that is to be tested for the screen size desired).

                                Even though the emulators cannot give you the exact environment needed for testing, they are a cost-effective solution to test an RW at a high-level.

That is, if we change the screen resolution from the size of the laptop to a mobile then the display of menu options should change dynamically.

                                    <strong>#3)</strong> URLs of a responsive website should also be resolution specific.

                                        <strong>Pre-requisite to test this scenario:</strong> Ask the developer to insert any sub-link into the Responsive testing website where the sub-link is not responsive.
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="uk-margin-medium-top">
                                        <u>For example</u>, the developer can insert link www.snapdeal.com to our testing website.
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="uk-margin-medium-top">
                                        Now, open the responsive testing website from a mobile and click on the sub-link mentioned in the pre-requisite. Then the URL of the sub-link should change to https://m.snapdeal.com.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                    <strong>#4)</strong> The same scenario can be tested from a laptop too. Open the RW from a desktop or laptop and click on the sub-link (mentioned in the pre-requisite of test scenario three) that is not responsive. The URL of the sub link should not change (as we are testing this scenario from the laptop the URL should remain the same).
                                </li>

                                    <strong>#5)</strong> <strong>Pre-requisite to test this scenario:</strong> Ask the developer to insert any sub-link, for example, www.paytm.com into the testing site. The mobile device in which you are going to execute this scenario should have the respective application of Paytm installed in the mobile.

                                    <p class="uk-margin-medium-top">
                                        Now open our testing responsive website from a mobile and click on the “paytm” sub-link. Then the Paytm application which is installed in the mobile should be opened. (The user should not be redirected to the website in the browser or another window; only the app should be open.)
                                    </p>

                                    <strong>#6)</strong> The images in the responsive website are resolution specific. It means that the resolution of the image inserted in the code of responsive website designed for mobile compatibility is different from that of a desktop or tablet. Each screen size should have its specific image in the design.

                                    <p class="uk-margin-medium-top">
                                        <strong>Pre-requisite to test this scenario:</strong> Testing and checking the resolution of the images could be a tough task. Ask the developer to insert three different images in the responsive website separately for mobile, tablet and desktop.
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="uk-margin-medium-top">

This should be different from that of the image shown for the desktop screen size. Now you can resize the window to mobile screen size and check the image. This image should also be different from the above two images.

                                        <strong>Note:</strong> In a few projects, the requirements talk about the pixel size and resolution of the screen for particular devices. (For example, a tablet view for their RW should be at 15:15 pixel and for a mobile, it should be at 10:10 etc.)

Now resize the window till the breakpoint of the tablet size and verify the changes that should happen to the image resolution and any other content. At breakpoints, the changes should happen dynamically (sometimes the changes will not happen at the breakpoints and may change at some other pixel size which is a defect.)

Most test groups will narrow the list of test devices down to a handful. Even then, the manual testing problem is hard or impossible to approach.

                                Developers cannot possibly anticipate all of the platform problems, and testers can’t catch them before release. Because of this, we find the occasional user interface issue in production.

                                Maybe someone reduced the size of their browser causing important text fields to be covered by a page label. Perhaps some code designed to handle dynamic page resizing breaks modal date pickers and never gets noticed by a normal test built on WebDriver. There are too many display options to build tests for and too little time.

                                Dynamic pages, things like advertising sliders, and content streamed in from users in different page sizes, are a staple of many software products. Add to this the fact that we can’t predict how the page will be displayed and many automation efforts start with failure.
                            </p>

                                I see two popular solutions for this problem — using a standardized, or baseline, data set and refreshing that every time the test suite is run, and taking things one environment or platform at a time.
                            </p>

                                Standard data ensures page content will look the same every time we load the test environment. That strategy combined with something like Sauce Labs that gives people access to many platforms and you get pretty far.

                                This approach takes time and resources. You will need time from someone with database access, usually a DBA, to create and update database exports. And, someone has to create scripts setup and teardown scripts to maintain the test environment. After all this effort, you might end up with the type of sanitized environment bugs love to hide in.

Using this tooling, you can create tests without any changes to your test environment, and without requiring any skill sets from people outside of your test group.
                            </p>

                                <strong>Let’s look at an example.</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p class="uk-margin-medium-top">
                                Consider the Twitter mobile app.
                            </p>
                            <p class="uk-margin-medium-top">
                                This product is a combination of continuously changing user content and advertising. There are also a few core parts of the user interface, such as the news feed and notifications, in the header.
                            </p>
                            <p class="uk-margin-medium-top">
                                Using a visual testing tool, you could start by performing a screen capture of the entire scrollable page, not just the viewable area. You could choose a comparison option that ignores text content but focuses on on-page elements.
                            </p>
                            <p class="uk-margin-medium-top">
                                <strong>For example</strong>, you could see that the fields for tweets exist, that each tweet has a name element and a date/time element, without worrying about what is in the elements.
                            </p>
                            <p class="uk-margin-medium-top">
                                Searching for elements across full pages also relieves the maintenance and complexity burden we see in many automated tests. Rather than manipulating data on a page, saving, scrolling and then verifying, you get everything in one shot. This means less code to write, less code to maintain, and fewer false positives in the nightly test runs.
                            </p>

                                Responsive design has added the combinatorial problem to every available platform. The question is; out of all of these possible platforms and screen sizes, which do we select for the best test coverage.
                            </p>

                            <p class="uk-margin-medium-top">
                                Reducing the number of environments we cover to only the most popular ones makes the technical task easier while also ignoring the coverage problem.
                            </p>

                            <p class="uk-margin-medium-top">
                                Increasing the number of environments with an automation framework alone creates a maintenance nightmare and potentially adds an unsolvable testing problem.
                            </p>

                            <p class="uk-margin-medium-top">
                                The combination of good visual testing tools with a flexible UI automation framework, such as web driver, can make the technical aspects of this problem not just easier to deal with, but solvable.
                            </p>

                            <p class="uk-margin-medium-top">
                                The target is good user interface coverage with a reasonable maintenance burden. Visual testing is your only robust and scalable option.

                                <strong>#1)</strong> While testing an RW you should mindful of the design consistency such as the alignment of images, texts, padding around the edges, etc. across all the browsers and Operating systems.
                            </p>
                            <p class="uk-margin-medium-top">
                                <strong>#2)</strong> During the testing of an RW, the tester should be aware of what to test and how to test on multiple devices at different breakpoints. Otherwise, it could be quite exhaustive and disorienting.
                            </p>
                            <p class="uk-margin-medium-top">
                                <strong>#3)</strong> For thorough testing of a responsive website, the tester and developer coordination is a must. The developer should help testers with creating the conditions mentioned in the prerequisites of the test cases.
                            </p>
                            <p class="uk-margin-medium-top">
                                <strong>#4)</strong>  Check whether the web pages are readable at all resolutions, i.e. the content should be readable even if we resize the browser to mobile screen size.
                            </p>
                            <p class="uk-margin-medium-top">
                                <strong>#5)</strong>  The important content of the RW should be visible for all breakpoints, i.e. if we change the browser size from desktop screen to mobile screen then the main images, main text, menu, etc. should remain the same.
                            </p>
                            <p class="uk-margin-medium-top">
                                <strong>#6)</strong>  If the browser is resized for testing then any click area (like buttons, menus, sub-links, etc.) of the RW should be suitable for clicking.
                            </p>
                            <p class="uk-margin-medium-top">
                                <strong>#7)</strong> Resizing the browser and testing the responsive website can identify only a few major issues whereas there may be a few other issues related to finger-swipes, tapping, etc. on mobile devices. Testing these particular features on the actual devices can lead to better defect finding and removal.
